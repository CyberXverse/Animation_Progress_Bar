# Animation_Progress_Bar
This is a temporal progress bar created to show you your levels of perfection in the world of computer science.lection of few

With the help of css i am able to add more designed ui to it to make it look perfect as a mordern website on it own.
the html wasnt that much because that was just thr structure of the page and the css did all the perfect job in the ui design mode like how Adobe Illustrator or Primier Pro would do with just selection of few ui tools form thier editing toolbar.

but being creative is needed

Nothings is never worth a harm, Just give it a try...
